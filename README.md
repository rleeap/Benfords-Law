# Benfords-Law
Benford's Law states that for certain large datasets, the most common leading digit of any data point is 1. This app takes in a CSV file of numerical data and determines if it reflects this phenomenon..

## How to Run The Program

Compile the Java file named BenfordsLaw.java with the following command:
javac BenfordsLaw.java

Then when prompted, enter the CSV file of your choice. Unfortunately there is no extensive handling of different formats of the CSV file, so make sure that each data value is separated by a new line, with no extra characters. 

The repository includes a CSV file called uscities2.csv that serves as an example of a data set that does reflect Benford's Law.
